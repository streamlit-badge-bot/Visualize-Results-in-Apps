# Visualize results in data apps 

Data Scientist often forget, that all their visualizations (and also model), which they have built, need to be used by someone, who is probably not as skilled in all these technical requirements. Therefore it is important to find a solution, which is easy to use for everyone, stable and quickly customizable. There are different solutions, but I found [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) fantastic, because I didn't have to spend time on building a webpage or learn HTML, CSS or Wordpress. Everyhing is in Python and once the setup is done (which is easy) everything I have to do for updating the whole data app is to save the Python file (no compiling needed). 

I used the data of the "Maraton runtimes" example above and as you can see I only had to change some very minor things in the python code (like `import stramlit as st` and write `st.pyplot(g)` instead of `plt.show()`) in order to create a "data app". You can upload another Excel-csv file by pressing the "Browse files" button, which will then be visualized. Using the checkboxes below will open more graphics (like histograms, kernel density, violion plots,...). See my [data app here](https://share.streamlit.io/andreastraut/visualize-results-in-apps/main/app_Example_Marathon_extended.py) and play around yourself.
